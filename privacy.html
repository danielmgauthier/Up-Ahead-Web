        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <br/>
        <p>This policy applies to all information collected or submitted in Up Ahead for iPhone, iPod Touch, iPad, and any other devices and platforms.</p>
        <br/>
        <h2>Our stance on privacy</h2>
        <br/>
        <p>We strongly believe that your data belongs to you. We do not collect any identifiable information about our users; we only track the bare minimum needed to debug issues and to view download and purchase trends.</p>
        <br/>
        <h2>What information does Up Ahead collect?</h2>
        <br/>
        <p>Up Ahead collects anonymized metadata using Apple’s built in metrics system. This system sends data such as session length, crash reports, device type, and locale. In addition, RevenueCat is used for anonymized purchase tracking. This means that when someone makes a purchase in the app, we see that a purchase was made at a particular time in a particular country; no other data is collected, and so this purchase data cannot be linked to a user’s identity. More information on RevenueCat’s privacy policy can be found <a href="https://www.revenuecat.com/privacy/">here</a>.</p>
        <br/>
        <p>No other information is collected at any time. Any data you enter into Up Ahead resides strictly on your device and in your personal iCloud account. We have no means of viewing any user-entered data. </p>
        <br/>
        <h2>What does Up Ahead do with this data?</h2>
        <br/>
        <p>Anonymized crash reports and device info are used to fix crashes within the app. Your anonymized device data may also be used to prioritize support for translating to certain languages. Total download count and other aggregated metrics may be used for marketing purposes.</p>
        <br/>
        <h2>Sharing information</h2>
        <br/>
        <p>Up Ahead allows you to share certain information, such as user-created events, to email, messaging or social media services. Up Ahead is in no way responsible for the protection of any information that you choose to share via the app’s sharing feature. You and your service providers are solely responsible for the protection of such information. Please review any applicable policies and procedures before sharing your information therein.</p>
        <br/>
        <h2>Your consent</h2>
        <br/>
        <p>By using Up Ahead, you consent to this privacy policy.</p>
        <br/>
        <h2>Changes to this policy</h2>
        <br/>
        <p>Changes to this privacy policy may periodically be made and posted here. Visit this page at any time to check for updates.</p>
